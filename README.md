# Business strategy with SQL

## Introduction:

I was hired as a data analyst at an Edtech company, a sector focused on education technology, with the goal of driving growth through data-driven strategies. The company's focus on accelerating its growth by increasing the number of registered users highlights the importance of understanding customer acquisition dynamics in the educational technology market. In response to this, I conducted a detailed analysis of various aspects of customer acquisition to assess the current status of new user growth within the company. The dashboard I developed provided valuable insights for the business team to develop actionable plans aimed at increasing the number of registered users and driving the company's growth.
